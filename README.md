# ABC Classification

ABC classification is a popular inventory management and categorization technique used in supply chain management, logistics, and inventory control. It categorizes items or products into three main groups based on their relative importance and value to the organization. Each group is assigned a letter (A, B, or C) to represent its priority or significance. Here's a description of each category:

Category A (High-Value Items):

These are the most valuable and critical items in your inventory.
Typically, Category A items represent a relatively small portion of the total items but account for a significant portion of the inventory's total value.
These items are essential to your business operations and often have high sales volume or high unit prices.
Special attention is required for Category A items to ensure they are well-stocked, monitored closely, and managed efficiently to prevent stockouts or shortages.
Category B (Moderate-Value Items):

Category B items fall in the middle in terms of importance and value.
They are moderately valuable compared to Category A items and make up a larger portion of the total items and inventory value.
These items are important for regular business operations but may not be as critical as Category A items.
They require a moderate level of attention and management to ensure they are adequately stocked and meet demand.
Category C (Low-Value Items):

Category C items are the least valuable and may represent a significant portion of the total items but contribute less to the overall inventory value.
They are often less critical to daily operations and may have lower sales volumes or lower unit prices.
While they are part of the inventory, they typically require minimal management effort and can often be managed with more relaxed inventory control policies.
The goal of ABC classification is to help organizations allocate resources and focus their attention on the most critical and valuable items in their inventory. By categorizing items into these groups, businesses can:

Optimize inventory levels and investment by prioritizing the management of high-value items.
Improve order fulfillment for critical items, reducing stockouts and customer dissatisfaction.
Streamline procurement and supply chain processes.
Identify opportunities to reduce carrying costs for less important items.
Enhance overall inventory management efficiency.
